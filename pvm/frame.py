    """A fake cell for closures.

    Closures keep names in scope by storing them not in a frame, but in a
    separate object called a cell.  Frames share references to cells, and
    the LOAD_DEREF and STORE_DEREF opcodes get and set the value from cells.

    This class acts as a cell, though it has to jump through two hoops to make
    the simulation complete:

        1. In order to create actual FunctionType functions, we have to have
           actual cell objects, which are difficult to make. See the twisty
           double-lambda in __init__.

        2. Actual cell objects can't be modified, so to implement STORE_DEREF,
           we store a one-element list in our cell, and then use [0] as the
           actual value.
